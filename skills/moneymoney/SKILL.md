# MoneyMoney Query

Query MoneyMoney accounts, transactions, categories, portfolios, and bank
statement PDFs via the `mm` CLI.

Process: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Prerequisite

**MoneyMoney must be running AND unlocked.** Run `mm status` first when in
doubt; if `unlocked: false`, ask the user to unlock the app GUI before
retrying.

## Decision Tree

```
User wants…
  ├── App health ─────────────── mm status
  ├── Account overview ────────── mm accounts list [--tree]
  │     └── Detail ──────────── mm accounts get <REF>
  ├── Recent transactions ────── mm transactions --account <REF> [--from YYYY-MM-DD]
  │     └── Filtered ────────── mm transactions --account <REF> --search "Supermarket"
  ├── Category tree ──────────── mm categories
  ├── Portfolio holdings ─────── mm portfolio --account <DEPOT-REF>
  ├── Bank statement PDFs ────── mm statements list [--account <REF>] [--since YYYY-MM-DD]
  │     └── Retrieve a PDF ──── mm statements get <FILENAME>
  ├── Send money / pay invoice ─ MM_ENABLE_WRITES=true mm transfer create --from <REF> --to <IBAN> --amount X.XX --purpose "..."
  │     └── Hold for later ──── add --into-outbox (lands in Ausgangskorb)
  ├── Direct debit ───────────── MM_ENABLE_WRITES=true mm transfer direct-debit --from <REF> --to <IBAN> --amount X.XX --mandate <MANDATE-ID>
  ├── SEPA XML batch ─────────── MM_ENABLE_WRITES=true mm transfer batch <file.xml>
  ├── Add offline entry ──────── MM_ENABLE_WRITES=true mm transaction add --account <OFFLINE-REF> --amount X.XX --purpose "..."
  └── Edit transaction meta ─── MM_ENABLE_WRITES=true mm transaction set <ID> [--checkmark] [--category "..."] [--comment "..."]
```

## Actions (Capability- and Permission-Gated)

Writes require `MM_ENABLE_WRITES=true`; without that exact process-start
capability, `mm` rejects them. `mm transfer *` and `mm transaction *` are also
intentionally absent from `allowed-tools`, so Claude Code prompts for approval
on every call. SEPA transfers additionally require confirmation and TAN entry
inside MoneyMoney.

If the user asks to write, do not claim that no tools exist. Confirm the exact
parameters, then run the command with the environment prefix. The host
permission prompt remains mandatory.

### Worked example — pay an invoice PDF

```
1. Read the PDF → extract recipient name, IBAN, amount, purpose /
   reference number.
2. Echo the parsed fields back to the user and get a "go ahead".
3. Pick a source account (usually the main Girokonto unless the
   user says otherwise).
4. MM_ENABLE_WRITES=true mm transfer create \
     --from "ING/Girokonto" \
     --to   "DE17500400000076139950" \
     --name "Anke Irma Johannmeier" \
     --amount 701.74 \
     --purpose "Rechnung 80500-01-2026"
5. MoneyMoney opens a pre-filled payment window. User reviews,
   enters TAN, and releases the transfer.
```

### Worked example — queue for later (`--into-outbox`)

```
MM_ENABLE_WRITES=true mm transfer create --from "ING/Girokonto" --to "DE..." \
  --amount 50.00 --purpose "Rent April" --into-outbox
```

The payment lands in MoneyMoney's Ausgangskorb and stays there until
the user releases it manually (useful for collecting several and
releasing them as a batch).

### Silent mutators — warn before running

`MM_ENABLE_WRITES=true mm transaction set` overwrites `--comment` and
`--category` without a second MoneyMoney prompt or an undo. Before calling it,
confirm the target transaction ID and the new value(s) with the user.
`--checkmark` is reversible by running `set` again with the opposite value.

## Bank Statements — Always Examine PDF Content

Questions like "what's in my latest statement?", "check my Trade
Republic statements", or "did my rent debit show up on the January
statement?" are **never** answered by filenames alone. Statements are
PDFs stored on disk; their filename is an index, not the content.

**The required workflow:**

```
1. mm statements list --account <REF> [--since YYYY-MM-DD] -o json
         ↓ pick the relevant statement(s) by bank/date/account_hint
2. mm statements get <EXACT_FILENAME>
         ↓ prints the absolute path to the PDF
3. Read <ABSOLUTE_PATH>
         ↓ Claude Code's Read tool accepts PDFs directly (page-aware)
```

The filename pattern `<AccountType>_<digits>_<DocType>_<YYYYMMDD>.pdf`
often gives you the account, the document kind (e.g., `Kontoauszug`,
`Entgeltaufstellung`, `Ertraegnisaufstellung`, `Depotauszug`,
`Information`), and a date — but never the numbers, charges, or
transaction lines the user actually wants.

Worked example — "what did my ING statement from January look like?":

```bash
mm statements list --account ING --since 2026-01-01 -o json | jq '.results'
#   → picks Girokonto_5437633269_Kontoauszug_20260108.pdf
mm statements get Girokonto_5437633269_Kontoauszug_20260108.pdf
#   → /Users/you/Library/Containers/.../Statements/ING/...pdf
#   Then: Read that path to see balances, transactions, fees, interest.
```

**Special cases:**

- **Bank-wide documents** (`Information_YYYYMMDD.pdf`, etc.) have no
  account hint and affect every account at that bank — always worth
  reading when the user asks "did anything change?".
- **Large statement sets**: use `--since` to bound the range rather
  than reading everything. Read only the PDFs plausibly relevant to
  the question.
- **Non-textual statements** (Trade Republic sometimes ships scanned
  PDFs): Read will return page-level image content; describe what's
  visible rather than pretending to have parsed text.
- **PDFs > 20 pages**: MoneyMoney's monthly `Kontoauszug` is often
  20–30 pages. `Read` refuses anything over 20 pages without the
  `pages` parameter. When it errors with *"too many pages"*, retry
  with `pages: "1-20"`, then `pages: "21-40"` for the rest.
- **`mm statements list` returns empty when you expect results**:
  the filename filter is heuristic. Fall back to a direct filesystem
  listing of the Statements folder and pick PDFs by name:

  ```bash
  ls "$HOME/Library/Containers/com.moneymoney-app.retail/Data/Library/Application Support/MoneyMoney/Statements/<Bank>/"
  ```

  Then `Read` the absolute path directly — same result as `mm
  statements get`, minus the filter.

## When `mm transactions` returns empty for historical periods

Banks (notably ING) purge synced transactions after roughly 90 days;
MoneyMoney only has what it pulled while active. **For anything older
than ~3 months, statement PDFs are the authoritative source**, not
`mm transactions`. If the user asks about last year's spending or a
specific transaction from months ago and `mm transactions --from …`
returns zero or suspiciously few rows, switch to `mm statements list`
and read the monthly `Kontoauszug` PDFs instead — don't conclude
"there's no data."

## Account References

`<REF>` is any of (first match wins in priority order):

1. **UUID** — stable, always unique
2. **IBAN** — mod-97 validated
3. **Account number** — PayPal email, legacy numbers
4. **Alias** — from `~/.config/mm/config.toml`
5. **`Bank/Name` path** — e.g., `"ING/Girokonto"`, `"Trade Republic/Girokonto"`
6. **Bare name** — only when unambiguous

**Names are NOT unique across banks.** Two "Girokonto" accounts under
different banks are common. If `mm accounts get Girokonto` errors with
`ambiguous_account`, disambiguate with a `Bank/Name` path:

```bash
mm accounts get "ING/Girokonto"
mm accounts get "Trade Republic/Girokonto"
```

## Output Formats

Defaults to **table** in terminal, **JSON** when piped (for agents). Override
with `--output json|ndjson|table`. Use `-F name,iban,balance` to filter
fields. For SEPA accounts `iban` is the normalized IBAN; for PayPal /
legacy accounts it's absent.

## JSON Envelope

Lists return:

```json
{"results": [...], "total_count": N, "showing": N, "has_more": bool}
```

Individual records (from `mm accounts get`) return the record object
directly.

## Common Pitfalls

| Wrong | Right | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `mm accounts get Girokonto` (when ambiguous) | `mm accounts get "ING/Girokonto"` | Names aren't unique |
| Parsing `mm accounts list` table output | `mm accounts list --output json` | JSON is stable |
| Running commands while app is locked | `mm status` first, then retry | Database access fails silently otherwise |
| Searching transactions without a date range | Always pass `--from` / `--to` | Default range is last 90 days |
| Answering a statement question from filenames alone | `mm statements get` + `Read` the PDF | Statements are PDFs — their content is the answer |
| "I can't make transfers — I have no tools for that" | Use `MM_ENABLE_WRITES=true mm transfer create`; the host prompts for approval and MoneyMoney still requires GUI+TAN | Writes require both the process capability and explicit host permission |
| `Read` fails with "too many pages" on a statement PDF | Retry with `pages: "1-20"` (and further chunks) | Claude Code caps unguided PDF reads at 20 pages |
| `mm transactions --from 2024-…` returns zero and you conclude "no data" | Switch to `mm statements list` + Read the monthly PDFs | Banks purge transactions after ~90 days; PDFs always contain the full history |
| `mm statements list --account "ING/Girokonto"` returns empty | `ls "$HOME/Library/Containers/com.moneymoney-app.retail/Data/Library/Application Support/MoneyMoney/Statements/ING/"` and Read the paths directly | Filename filter is heuristic; bypass it when it misses |

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | General error |
| 2 | Usage / field filter / ambiguous account reference |
| 3 | Not found (account, transaction, statement) |
| 4 | AppleScript / I/O error |
| 5 | MoneyMoney locked or not running |
