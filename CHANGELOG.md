# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Security

- Disable CLI and MCP writes unless `MM_ENABLE_WRITES=true`; read-only MCP
  servers hide and reject all five write tools.
- Encode every AppleScript string, bound `osascript` execution time and
  captured output, use absolute system executable paths, and validate transfer
  IBANs and amounts.
- Snapshot SEPA batch files through no-follow, descriptor-relative opens before
  MoneyMoney imports them, preventing path-swap escapes from its container.
- Keep write capability host-controlled; agent guidance never self-enables it.
- Remove plugin-managed binary downloads and macOS quarantine removal.
- Pin GitHub Actions to immutable commits and remove prebuilt release
  automation until a signed, verified distribution path exists.

### Fixed

- Preserve an empty statement root when the home directory is unavailable and
  group encoded batch paths before AppleScript's `POSIX file` coercion.
- Canonicalize plugin `PATH` directories so a symlinked shim cannot execute
  itself recursively.

### Changed

- Make `parithosh/moneymoney` the canonical upstream and require source-built
  installation for the fork.
- Keep MCP transport local to stdio with rmcp default features disabled.

### Added

- Document the trust boundaries and private vulnerability reporting process in
  `SECURITY.md`.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-08-24

### Changed

- Refresh dependencies via `cargo update`, including `rmcp` 3.1.4.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-13

### Changed

- The MCP server speaks protocol 2026-07-28. Older clients still negotiate
  2025-06-18.
- Truncated table cells now end with `…` instead of `...` (comfy-table 8).

## [0.6.1] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- Resolve the bundled MCP server via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/mm` instead of a
  bare `mm` command. Plugin hosts spawn the stdio MCP server without the plugin's
  `bin/` on `PATH`, so the bare name failed with "Executable not found in $PATH".

### Changed

- Bump dependencies: `rmcp` 1.7.0, `plist` 1.9.0, `rust_decimal` 1.42.1, and refresh
  transitive dependencies via `cargo update`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- Add Codex plugin metadata and marketplace packaging alongside the existing
  Claude Code plugin.
- Add bundled MCP configuration for plugin and desktop hosts using `mm mcp`.

### Changed

- Make the plugin shim and binary-sync hook work with Codex plugin
  environment variables as well as Claude Code's variables.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed

- Plugin shim `bin/mm` and SessionStart hook `hooks/ensure-binary.sh`
  now fall back to a pure-bash `sed` extractor when `jq` is not on
  PATH, so the first `mm` invocation no longer fails on stock macOS,
  Alpine, and slim Linux containers.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- `mm statements list --account "Bank/Name"` (e.g.
  `"ING/Girokonto"`) now matches. Previously the filter only
  accepted bare bank names or account-number digits; the
  `Bank/Name` form — the one the skill recommends — silently
  returned zero results because the needle didn't match either
  the bank folder or the filename's digit hint.
- IBAN-form account refs (`DE…5437633269`) are now recognized by
  the statements filter via trailing-digit matching against the
  filename's `account_hint`.

### Changed

- Extracted the statements account filter into
  `statements::matches_account` and deduplicated CLI + MCP
  call sites. Both now share the same form-aware matcher.

### Skill

- "Bank Statements" section now warns about the 20-page Read
  limit and the `pages: "1-20"` workaround.
- New section "When `mm transactions` returns empty for
  historical periods" — tells the agent to fall through to
  statement PDFs when bank sync has gaps.
- New fallback note for `mm statements list` returning empty:
  direct `ls` of the Statements folder bypasses the heuristic
  filter.
- Three new Common Pitfalls rows covering the failure modes
  above.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- `iban` field on account output (table column, JSON key, `-F iban`
  filter). Populated for SEPA accounts whose `account_number` passes
  mod-97; absent for PayPal and legacy numbers.
- Skill decision tree and frontmatter now cover write intents:
  "Überweisung", "Lastschrift", "SEPA", "transfer", "direct debit",
  "send money", "pay this invoice". The skill triggers on those
  phrases and walks through drafting `mm transfer create` with the
  permission prompt + GUI/TAN as the safety gates.

### Changed

- Skill body reorganized: a prominent "Actions (Permission-Prompted)"
  section moves ahead of statement handling, with worked examples for
  paying an invoice PDF and queueing into MoneyMoney's Ausgangskorb.
- "Write Subcommands" tail section removed (content moved up).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- `mm transfer create` / `direct-debit` / `batch` — initiate SEPA
  payments. Safe by construction: MoneyMoney either opens a pre-filled
  payment window (default) or places the payment into the outbox
  (`--into-outbox`); user confirms and enters TAN in the GUI.
- `mm transaction add` — append manual entries to offline-managed
  accounts (non-offline targets are rejected at resolve time).
- `mm transaction set` — mutate checkmark / category / comment on an
  existing transaction by numeric id.
- MCP write tools mirroring the CLI verbs, with correct
  `readOnlyHint` / `destructiveHint` annotations per the MCP
  2025-06-18 spec.
- AppleScript-string hardening: reject `"` and newlines in user input
  at the clap / parameter layer, escape `\` during script generation
  (MoneyMoney uses `\` to separate nested category names).
- `MockOsascriptRunner` for golden-string tests of write verbs without
  touching a live MoneyMoney install.
- Release workflow building release archives for
  `{x86_64,aarch64}-unknown-linux-gnu` and
  `{x86_64,aarch64}-apple-darwin` on tag push.
- First public release artifacts at `v0.2.0`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- Initial scaffold.
- AppleScript dispatcher with `DatabaseLocked` / `NotRunning` /
  `NotInstalled` error classification.
- Domain types for `Account`, `Transaction`, `Category`, `Security`,
  decoded from MoneyMoney's plist output with float-noise-free
  `rust_decimal` conversion.
- Account resolver accepting UUID / IBAN (mod-97 validated via
  `iban_validate`) / account number / alias / `Bank/Name` path / bare
  name, with explicit ambiguity detection.
- Optional TOML config loader at XDG paths for alias definitions.
- Read subcommands: `mm status`, `mm accounts list/get` (with `--tree`
  and `--include-groups`), `mm transactions`, `mm categories`,
  `mm portfolio`, `mm statements list/get`, `mm version`.
- Output module (table / JSON / NDJSON) with field filtering and
  structured JSON errors.
- MCP server (`mm mcp`) over stdio via `rmcp` with read-only tools.
- `stderr`-only tracing subscriber (compact for CLI, JSON for MCP).
- Claude Code plugin metadata (`.claude-plugin/`), PostToolUse skill
  nudge hook, and `bin/mm` shim that defers to a user-installed binary.
- GitHub Actions CI covering fmt, clippy, MSRV, tests (macOS + Linux),
  audit, and rustdoc.
